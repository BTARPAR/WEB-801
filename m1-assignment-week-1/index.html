        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>
            The County of Los Angeles Department of Animal Care and Control is one of the largest and most progressive
            animal control agencies in the United States. DACC has adopted the philosophy of Socially Conscious Animal
            Sheltering at our seven animal care centers. We serve unincorporated Los Angeles County and 44 contract
            cities
            with a combined total population of over 3 million residents. We cover more than 3,400 square miles of
            cities,
            deserts, beaches, and mountains; from the Antelope Valley in the north to the Palos Verdes Peninsula in the
            south, as far east as the border of San Bernardino County, and west to Thousand Oaks. We provide animal
            control
            and rescue services in our service areas 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our animal care centers offer a wide variety of potential pets for you to choose. Most of our animals are
            either strays or pets turned in by owners who are no longer able to keep them. The many benefits of adopting
            from a County Animal Care Center include lowâ€‘cost spaying/neutering, a free veterinary checkup, the peace of
            mind knowing that your new pet has received its initial vaccinations against contagious diseases, and the
            satisfaction of having saved the life of a shelter animal. Besides patrolling busy streets, back roads,
            beaches, and canyons for lost, injured, and abandoned animals, our animal control officers also conduct
            humane investigations when animal cruelty is suspected, provide emergency rescues during natural disasters,
            enforce all State and local animal control laws, conduct animal licensing (canvassing) inspections; and
            inspect and license commercial animal facilities.

            <p>Adopted November 2020 || Maine Coon</p>
            <img src="images/sylvester.png" alt="William & Sylvester" width="450">
            <article>
                Sylvester is a senior citizen - at 12 years old, it could have been difficult to find an adoptive
                family. But he is perfect for our family - kind, gentle, loving and sweet. He's been with us for less
                than a month, but he is already at home with all 6 of us, even approaching the younger children without
                hesitation. He is such a sweetheart and we are thrilled to have him in our home!

            <h3>Debra & Kaya, Holly & Mickey</h3>
            <p>Adopted December 2020 || Yorkshire Terrier / Chihuahua</p>
            <img src="images/three-pets.png" alt="Holly, Mickey & Kaya" width="450">
            <article>
                As soon as I saw those three sweet faces, I was in love! I knew these senior dogs were meant to be with
                me. I received them on 12/19/20 and the adoption was finalized on 1/6/21. Three wonderful personalities
                that mesh well with mine. Our walks together, give me incentive, to get outside in the fresh air. As a
                senior myself, dealing with daily pain, these three kids, are all I need to push past the pain and live
                again!
